    "Predicting COVID-19 ICU Admissions\n",
    "Brazil has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 16 million confirmed cases and 454 429 confirmed deaths as of May 26, 2021. The country was unprepared for the pandemic, and was unable to respond adequately due to the strain on hospital capacity.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "A data science team at a top-tier hospital in Brazil has released a dataset on the Kaggle platform which seeks interesting solutions and findings from the public. The team is using ML to help reduce the strain on hospital's ICU beds, where the objective is to develop a ML model to predict if a patient of a confirmed COVID-19 case will require admission to the ICU.\n",

    "The dataset collected for the research is publicly available on the datascience platform Kaggle. A full description of the dataset can be found on the platform:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/S%C3%ADrio-Libanes/covid19\n",

    "In this assignment, you are challenged to perform a full lifecycle ML model development according to the objective of the dataset, which includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to gain an understanding of the Data\n",
    "Preprocess the Data to prepare it for the ML Model\n",
    "Develop a few candidate ML models and pick the most promising one. Evaluate it based on a variety of metrics as well as analysing it’s performance (does it overtrain, can we improve it by changing our data preprocessing etc.)\n",
    "Deliverables:\n",
    "Upload your code to a github repository as a Jupyter Notebook. Use the commit system to update your progress whenever you are working on the progress (rather than just upload the file at the end). Ensure you have a readme that explains what you are doing.\n",
    "Executive Presentation: Prepare a presentation for the board of executives where you explain why your model can help save lives, why the hospital should start using it and present it’s performance as well as trends in the data you discovered during EDA.\n",
    "Research Report: Write a paper with up to 2000 words (this can be less as long as the important information is included) where you present your methods and finding to an expert audience. Your paper should roughly follow the structure:\n",
    "Introduction (why are we analysing the data/What is the problem)\n",

    "The student confidently applies all concepts learned in the course. They have made the project their own and have gone beyond what would normally be expected. Their research is completely independent with very well explained methodology. The code is efficient and clean with complete docstring commenting and following of PEP8 guidelines. The text could reasonably come from a Bachelors/Graduate Data Science student and contains all the elements one would expect from a “real” research report. The presentation is creative, shows the data accurately whilst being convincing and telling the story of a successful project. They student has exceeded expectations.\n",
